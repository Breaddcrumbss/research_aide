KONICA MINOLTA BUSINESS SOLUTIONS ASIA PTE. LTD. v NPE PRINT COMMUNICATIONS PTE. LTD.,"The Court determined that the contract between Konica and NPE was valid and enforceable. The Court applied the principle of contractual interpretation that the contract should be read as a whole and all parts should be given effect, if possible. The Court also denied NPE's counterclaim against Konica for breach of contract."
Government of the City of Buenos Aires v HN Singapore Pte Ltd & Anor,"The Court of Appeal determined that the defendants had made a false representation with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to enter into the contract, and that the plaintiff had acted to its detriment in reliance on that representation. The Court of Appeal further determined that the payment of the balance purchase price and “other charges, expenses and fees” was a condition of the contract, and the defendants’ failure to pay this amount constituted a repudiatory breach. The Court must now consider the claims for damages, interest, legal costs, and any other relief deemed fit by the Court."
LOW SING KHIANG v LOGICMILLS LEARNING CENTRE PTE. LTD. & 2 Ors,"This case concerns a dispute between the Plaintiff and Defendants regarding a Shareholders' Agreement (SHA) between the Plaintiff and Logicmills. The Plaintiff alleges that Logicmills had agreed to contribute $80,000 to the paid-up capital of a joint venture company in exchange for 30,000 ordinary shares, as per the SHA. The Defendants deny this and allege that they had verbally agreed to contribute assets in lieu of cash. The Plaintiff further alleges that the Defendants had agreed to temporarily fund the joint venture on behalf of himself and Logicmills, and had represented that the programmes and curriculum offered by Logicmills were endorsed, validated and certified by the Ministry of Education, Singapore. The legal principles of misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, as stated in Strait Colonies Pte Ltd v SMRT Alpha Pte Ltd [2018] 2 SLR 441, are applicable to the present case. The Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation against the Defendants, as the alter egos of Logicmills, and thus the Plaintiff’s claims are valid. Judgment is reserved."
