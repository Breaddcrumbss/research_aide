      <p class="card-text">Search engines like LawNet search using the individual words, leading to 
        frustration when one does not know the exact terms to use. We imagine a system where a lawyers 
        can simply be as specific and detailed as possible in their searches, providing as many facts 
        as possible, and from that obtain cases which are of the same category. A search algorithm like 
        this would first try to categories the input text using chains of catchwords, such as:
      </br>
      <strong>[Charities — Charity proceedings — Interpretation of s 32 of the Charities Act 1994]</strong>
        </p>

      <p class="card-text">From there, the algorithm will conduct a search on existing cases and their 
        catchwords to retrieve the most relevant cases, down to the most nuanced categorisation. Young 
        lawyers will be better equipped to find and learn about potentially esoteric categories. A classification 
        algorithm like this will also benefit law reporting as it is automatic and systematic, leaving no room 
        for error when tagging a case.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">An AI-summarizer is beneficial on multiple levels. A brief summary of a long 
        text is always welcome, but we envision the ability to tailor each summary given what the user wants
         to focus on. In a case of five issues, perhaps one may just want a summary of only one of them. Tailored 
         summaries using AI greatly increase the efficieny of research and allow the lawyers to craft precise 
         arguments. Headnotes for law reports can thus be automatically generated using this technology.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        The culmination of all these ideas lies in a chatbot, one that is connected to our legal database, 
        ensuring its ability to retrieve relevant local cases, and back up its statements with pinpoint citations. 
        With additional training on legal data, it will help even the most experienced lawyer formulate arguments 
        and test strategies in prolonged conversation.

            My client bought a car from a second-hand retailer. He agreed to buy
            the car for 10000 dollars but it was only worth 5000 dollars. He was
            told that the car was manufactured in France but it was actually
            manufactured in Indonesia. He feels he was cheated out of his money

            the settlor settled certain assets on trust for the first claimant
            for life, with remainder on her death to the second claimant. The
            trust fund and income were subject to an overriding power of
            appointment in favour of an appointed class. The claimants promoted
            a scheme of arrangement to convert the second claimant's interest in
            remainder to a life interest with remainders over. They obtained the
            consent of the adult members of the appointed class to the proposed
            arrangement, and sought the court's consent on behalf of the child
            members pursuant to its discretion under section 1(1)(a) of the
            Variation of Trusts Act 1958 to approve an arrangement on behalf of
            a child having “an interest” under a trust. The power of appointment
            being a mere power rather than a trust power, the question arose
            whether the child members of the class had “an interest” under the
            trust for the purposes of section 1(1).
